What is select?  Who knows? It’s MG&E so confusion is expected. Level 2 chargers appear to be priced now at $0.18/kwh. Again, as with so much with MG&E, it is unclear if the $0.05/kwh discount applies to these units(edited)  Was this helpful?  driver found this helpful  drivers found this helpful"

Nice location. Lot was completely empty on a Sunday and I stayed at a hotel a block away with a slip in the window.
