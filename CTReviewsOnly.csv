In CT disconnecting a charger from another persons car while it's charging without their permission is considered damaged to personal property and is punishable by law.

Owner paid for Damages rather than Pressing Charges for this and having them arrested.

Even if a person Parks there car in the Middle of your front lawn you cannot move it yourself. You have to have an officer approve the towing and have a licensed professional move it.

When you get to Union Station, drop your car at the curb using the Valet Lane.  Leave your ChargePoint RFID proximity card on the passenger seat and have a quick chat with the valet about how to use it to activate the charger and how many hours it will need to charge (at 6 kW).  Upon return a few days later, call that same valet hotline number from the train while 20 to 30 minutes out, and they will fetch your car.  Cost is $25 per day plus tip.  Note that the valet and the garage are separate businesses, accustomed to working together, and in this scenario, you are a customer of the valet service, not the garage.(edited)  Was this helpful?  driver found this helpful  drivers found this helpful",256069,"New Haven Union Station | New Haven, CT | EV Station",https://www.plugshare.com/location/5962

If you have a Chevy - try the nearby dealer, as they have free L2 charging for GM brands. For late night visits - walk to the 24/7 Dunkin' Donuts.
